Introduction
-----

This project is a higher-order fork:
[MovingBlocks] → [simoarpe] → [ice1000]
For more information, please refer to the original project(s).

I'm just doing the obvious things:

* In the source code, I
  * Upgrade Gradle & LibGDX versions
  * Use Java 8 language features
  * Fix some obvious bugs, such as `for (int i = xxx.length; i >= 0; i--)`
* Project level, I
  * Provide prebuilt binaries
  * Upload the project to maven central
